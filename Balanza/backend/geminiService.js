ALl the goals are monthly and the amount is in rupees.Also the total spent is also monthly.
        
        Analyze this spending data and provide insights in three key areas:
        1. **Major Overspending Areas, based on how close they are from their goal** (Where is the user spending too much and If a user has already spent 20-30% of their goal in the first few days (e.g., within the first 5-10 days),how likely are they to exceed their goal.)
        2. **Potential Saving Opportunities** (Where can they cut costs?)
        3. for high spent tags,Use the current date to get idea of how likely they are to exceed their goals.
        4. **Notable Spending Trends** (compared to previous 2 months only if there is data available for that)
        - **Limit response to 5 bullet points maximum.**
        - **Provide only important takeaways, not detailed explanations.**
        - **Ensure responses are practical and actionable.**
